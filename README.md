# Capt. Caspian
A simple platforming game inspired by early Nintendo and Atari games.

This was my first game I tried my hand at making (unless you count that Flappy bird game I learnt with my JavaScript course back in 2017).
It was my entry to The Lyceum College LyTech Fair 2023.

See if you can find the secret room ;)
